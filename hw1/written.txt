//Problem 1
I've tried Kate, Emacs and vim. I think Emacs works better for me.It's faster and the the GUI looks similar as that of txt in windows.

//Problem 2
16 C++ is easy to understand.
17 The symbos "\n" means the end of the line in the output so that and the next output will be on the following  line.
18 Read the next number that is typed in from the keyboard and to send it to the variable named "peas_per_pod".
19 Multiply the two numeric variables "number_of_pods" and "peas_per_pod", and send the result to the variable named "total_peas".
20 The "#include <iostream>" is used to include the "isostram" library, which includes functions like cin, cout, <<, etc. for input and output.

1 Tools and Ingredients:
  A full jar of Peanut Butter
  A full jar of Jelly
  Breads(sliced or whole)
  Cutting board
  1 Knife
  1 tablesSpoon

2 If the bread is not already sliced, use one knife(k1) to slice 2 slices from the whole bread on Cutting board

3 If the lid of peanut better jar is not open, open the lid. 

4 Using one spoon, scoop out 2 tablespoons(s1) of peanut butter and deposit in the center of b1.

5 Using k1, spread the peanut butter evenly across this side of s1.

6 Clean k1, s1

7 Repeat 3-6 with Jelly b2 k1 s1.(The idea i to swrite a function with variables: sources, bread, knife and spoon to cover 3-6 and use it again here in 7.)

8 Place Slice 2 on top of Slice 1 so that the sources (peanut butter and jelly) are between the two slices and the externally-facing sides of each slice do not have sources.

I'm always missing ";" so there are errors. I just add it when necessary.
It also happens when I miss "using namespace std;".
