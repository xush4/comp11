// Two dice game
//Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to 
//the turn total.
//If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
//If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
//If a double(not 1s) is rolled,a bonus 10 point is offered to the total number.
